# 🚀 Lucy 2.0 Multi-Agent Streamlit Demo - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This Streamlit app demonstrates the benefits of Lucy 2.0's multi-agent approach vs the single-agent system. It provides an interactive interface to showcase:

- **Agent Specialization**: PhotoVerifier, BusinessCoach, and Underwriter agents
- **Real-time Processing**: Visual demonstration of parallel agent work
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Single-agent vs Multi-agent benefits
- **Langfuse Tracing**: Mock tracing dashboard showing performance metrics

## 🖥️ Demo Features

### 1. **System Comparison View**
- Visual metrics showing 3 agents, 7 tasks, 60% speed improvement
- Agent activity dashboard with real-time status
- Critical path progress tracking (B1→B4→E4b→E6→L3→L5)
- Side-by-side comparison of single vs multi-agent approaches

### 2. **Interactive Demo**
- Photo upload simulation for PhotoVerifier agent
- Customer message processing by all agents
- Real-time agent work simulation with progress bars
- Multi-agent system output demonstration

### 3. **Langfuse Tracing Dashboard**
- Token usage per agent
- Cost breakdown and performance metrics  
- Quality scores and processing times
- Total system performance overview

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (FREE - Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub** (already done - this repo is ready!)

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository: `lucy-multi-agent`
   - Main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Your app will be live at:** `https://lucy-multiagent-[random].streamlit.app`

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# Open browser to: http://localhost:8501
```

### Option 3: Railway (Paid Alternative)

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Railway will auto-detect Streamlit and deploy
3. Get a custom domain and better performance

## 🎯 Demo Usage Guide

### For Stakeholder Presentations:

1. **Start with System Comparison** - Show the metrics and benefits overview
2. **Walk through Agent Dashboard** - Explain each agent's specialization
3. **Run Interactive Demo** - Process a sample customer message
4. **Show Langfuse Tracing** - Demonstrate observability benefits

### Key Talking Points:

**Single-Agent Limitations:**
- Context switching between photo analysis, coaching, and underwriting
- Inconsistent quality across different skill domains
- Sequential processing leading to slower response times
- Difficult to optimize specific capabilities

**Multi-Agent Benefits:**
- ✅ **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on their domain
- ✅ **Parallel Processing**: Photo analysis while conducting interviews  
- ✅ **Quality Consistency**: Dedicated agents ensure uniform standards
- ✅ **Modular Updates**: Improve individual capabilities independently
- ✅ **Full Traceability**: Track each agent's decision process with Langfuse

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Real CrewAI Integration:
1. Set environment variables in Streamlit Cloud:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` 
   - `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `LANGFUSE_HOST`

2. Update `streamlit_app.py` to use live CrewAI agents instead of simulation

### Styling Customizations:
- Modify CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections
- Update colors, fonts, and layouts
- Add your company branding

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Load Time**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Demo Runtime**: ~30 seconds for full multi-agent simulation
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB (lightweight)
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ (Streamlit Cloud free tier)

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Deploy immediately** using Streamlit Cloud (5 minutes)
2. **Test the demo** with various customer messages
3. **Customize branding** and messaging for your audience
4. **Share the URL** with stakeholders for remote demonstrations
5. **Iterate based on feedback** - easy to update via git push
