# Lucy 2.0 - LangChain Multi-Agent Implementation

A seamless customer experience with hidden multi-agent orchestration for loan processing.

## 🎯 Goal

Build a customer-facing application where users go through the loan flow seamlessly **without realizing they are interacting with different "agents"**. The multi-agent architecture works behind the scenes to provide specialized expertise while maintaining a unified "Lucy" experience.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Single Lucy Interface
- Customer always talks to "Lucy" 
- No awareness of multiple agents
- Consistent personality and tone throughout

### Hidden Agent Orchestration
- **PhotoVerifier**: Handles image analysis and Photo Income Notes (Task B1)
- **BusinessCoach**: Manages relationship building and goal setting (Tasks E4a, E4b, E6)
- **Underwriter**: Processes financial data and loan structuring (Tasks B4, L3, L5, OFFER)

### Smart State Management
- Tracks customer data throughout the journey
- Automatic task progression: B1→E4A→E4B→B4→E6→L3→L5→OFFER
- Context preservation across agent handoffs

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ **Seamless Experience**: Customer never knows about different agents  
✅ **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent has domain-specific knowledge  
✅ **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic message routing to appropriate agent  
✅ **State Tracking**: Complete journey tracking with data extraction  
✅ **Demo Mode**: Works without external dependencies for testing  

## 📁 Files

- `lucy_ai.py` - Main LangChain implementation with multi-agent orchestration
- `app.py` - FastAPI backend with REST endpoints
- `test_lucy.py` - Test suite demonstrating complete customer journey
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run the complete test suite
python test_lucy.py

# Test specific customer journey
python -c "
from lucy_ai import LucyAI
lucy = LucyAI('demo-key')
response, state = lucy.chat('Hi, I need a loan for my shop')
print(response)
"
```

## 🌐 FastAPI Backend

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python app.py

# Available endpoints:
# POST /chat - Main chat interface
# GET /session/{id} - Session information
# GET /sessions - List all sessions
# GET /analytics - System analytics  
# POST /demo - Run complete demo
```

## 📊 Customer Journey Flow

1. **B1**: Photos & Location → PhotoVerifier analyzes business images
2. **E4A**: Business Type → BusinessCoach asks about business 
3. **E4B**: What They Love → BusinessCoach builds rapport
4. **B4**: Sales Data → Underwriter analyzes financials
5. **E6**: Challenge → BusinessCoach identifies obstacles
6. **L3**: Loan Usage → Underwriter structures loan purpose
7. **L5**: Readiness → Underwriter confirms readiness
8. **OFFER**: Final Offer → Underwriter generates loan terms

## 🆚 Multi-Agent vs Single Agent Benefits

| Single Agent | Multi-Agent (This Implementation) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Generic responses | Specialized expertise per domain |
| Inconsistent evaluation | Uniform standards per agent type |
| Sequential processing | Parallel processing capabilities |
| Monolithic updates | Modular agent improvements |
| Difficult debugging | Clear agent attribution |

## 🔧 Demo Mode

The system works in demo mode without LangChain/OpenAI API keys:
- Provides realistic responses for each agent
- Demonstrates complete customer journey
- Shows state management and routing
- Perfect for testing and demonstrations

## 🎉 Success Metrics

✅ **Complete Journey**: Customer reaches loan OFFER stage  
✅ **Seamless Experience**: No awareness of agent transitions  
✅ **Data Collection**: All required customer data captured  
✅ **Specialized Processing**: Each agent handles appropriate tasks  
✅ **State Preservation**: Context maintained throughout conversation  

## 📋 **Function Integration Complete**

✅ **calculate_loan_offer**: Generates structured loan offers with full underwriting data  
✅ **task_complete**: Tracks task completion progress throughout customer journey  
✅ **store_customer_acceptance**: Handles loan acceptance/rejection and triggers disbursement  

## 🎨 **UI Design Matching**

✅ **Login Flow**: Session management with phone number authentication  
✅ **Chat Interface**: WhatsApp-style messaging with Lucy's profile image
