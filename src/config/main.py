Hello! I'm Lucy, your AI loan officer and business partner. I received your message: "{user_input}"

I would normally process this through my three specialized agents:

1. **PhotoVerifier** - Would analyze any business photos you provide
2. **BusinessCoach** - Would help you set specific business goals and loan purposes  
3. **Underwriter** - Would assess risk and generate a loan offer

For now, I'm running in deployment mode. Once fully configured with your API keys, I'll be able to provide complete loan processing services.

To get started, please provide:
- Photos of your business location
- Your specific business goals
- How you plan to use the loan

I'm here to help you succeed! ðŸš€
