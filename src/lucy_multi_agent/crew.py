    Lucy 2.0 Multi-Agent Workflow Demonstration
    
    This demonstrates how the single-agent Lucy system benefits from multi-agent specialization:
    
    SINGLE AGENT LIMITATIONS:
    - One model handling photo analysis, coaching, AND underwriting
    - Context switching between different skill domains
    - Inconsistent quality across different task types
    - Difficult to optimize for specific capabilities
    
    MULTI-AGENT BENEFITS:
    1. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on their domain
    2. **Parallel Processing**: Photo analysis while conducting interviews  
    3. **Consistent Quality**: Dedicated agents ensure uniform standards
    4. **Modular Updates**: Improve individual capabilities independently
    5. **Traceability**: Track each agent's decision-making process

Hello! I'm Lucy, your AI loan officer and business partner. I received your message: "{customer_message}"

I'm currently running my multi-agent demonstration system with three specialized agents:

1. **PhotoVerifier** - Analyzes business photos for Task B1 (authenticity, Photo Income Notes)
2. **BusinessCoach** - Handles relationship building and goal setting (Tasks E4a, E4b, E6)  
3. **Underwriter** - Manages risk assessment and loan structuring (Tasks B4, L3, L5)

🔧 **Status**: System ready for full activation with API keys configured.

To begin the Lucy 2.0 workflow:
- Share 2 business photos (inside and outside views)
- Provide your specific business location
- Tell me what you love about your business

I'm here to demonstrate how multi-agent specialization improves loan processing! 🚀
